# Bioinformatics-Codebase
Codebase containing .py libraries with various bioinformatics functions and classes in Python

"Bioinformatics_Problems_Notebook" is a Jupyter notebook that applies these functions and classes  
  
  Within this notebook are my answers to the honors programming assignments in the UCSD course: "Bioinformatics I: Finding Hidden Messages in DNA"
