# Bioinformatics-Codebase
Codebase containing .py libraries with various bioinformatics functions and classes in Python  

> "Bioinformatics_Functions" contains functions for variant calling, sequence alignment, motif enumeration, and more.
> "NGS_Functions" contains functions for parsing and analyzing NGS data (.fq and .fa files)
> "Classes" contains classes I wrote for a DNA sequence object and a list of DNA sequences object

"Bioinformatics_Problems_Notebook" is a Jupyter notebook that applies these functions and classes  
  
> Within this notebook are my answers to the honors programming assignments in the UCSD course: "Bioinformatics I: Finding Hidden Messages in DNA"
