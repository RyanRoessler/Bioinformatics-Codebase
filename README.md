# Bioinformatics-Codebase

Codebase containing .py libraries with various bioinformatics functions and classes in Python
<ul>
  <li>"Bioinformatics_Functions.py" contains functions for variant calling, sequence alignment, motif enumeration, and more.</li>
  <li>"NGS_Functions.py" contains functions for parsing and analyzing NGS data (.fq and .fa files).</li>
  <li>"Classes.py" contains classes I wrote for a DNA sequence object and a list of DNA sequences object.</li>
</ul>

"Bioinformatics_Problems_Notebook" is a Jupyter notebook that applies these functions and classes
<ul>
  <li>Within this notebook are my answers to the honors programming assignments in the UCSD course: "Bioinformatics I: Finding Hidden Messages in DNA".</li>
  <li>This notebook also contains the use of other functions for analyzing NGS data and using OOP.</li>
</ul>
